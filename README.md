## Project Overview: End-to-End Data Science Capstone on Amazon Product Dataset

This is project aims to analyze and model an Amazon product dataset using a complete data science pipeline, from data collection to machine learning model deployment.

### Introduction:
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce data to derive insights that can help refine product offerings. 

This project is an end-to-end data science pipeline covering data collection, processing, and modeling.

It aims to extract meaningful insights from real-world datasets using machine learning techniques.

The process involves web scraping, data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling.

The objective is to apply both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques for better decision-making.

Performance evaluation and hyperparameter tuning help optimize model accuracy and efficiency.

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
